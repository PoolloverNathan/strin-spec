# Echo Channel Type

This is a channel type that can be used for simple tests. Implementors SHOULD implement this channel type and have it enabled by default under the type ID 0x1117. A connection to any properly-formed echo channel ID **MUST** be accepted. The response payload **MUST** be identical to the request payload. All future Client Data packets **MUST** be replied to with Server Data packets containing an identical payload. The server **MUSTÂ NOT** supply any data.
